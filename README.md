# ISR/DWE-style Objects II

![Example.](/_readme/all.png)

## About

Quast65's ISR/DWE-style Objects is a NewGRF popular with lovers of eyecandy industrial zones and ports. **ISR/DWE-style Objects II** is not meant as a replacement, but rather an update. You will find everything you are used to have at your disposal: objects from the ISR and DWE stations, dock- and road-overlapping tiles, drive-through tiles etc.; hopefully well-arranged and redone in a more user-friendly way.<br>
The original is, however, still very usable and can be loaded side by side with this version.

Nevertheless, there were several incentives that motivated the creation of a modernized clone - one of the strongest was to eliminate the _multi-item objects_ (whose randomness can drive even the strongest men into a padded cell).
Another reason was the unification of styles - some of the more popular industries are FIRS sets (accompanied by CHIPS stations) with their own _ground_ and _foundations style_. Brickblock1's "CHIPS style dock objects" already allows to build docks visually compatible with FIRS' graphics so it served as a big inspiration for this object set.

Once the original NewGRF was dissected, an effort was put into making the ground tiles replaceable which resulted in **two variants** of this new offshoot:

### _a) Clean concrete_

### _b) Dirty concrete_

These are two separate .grf files with **unique GRFIDs**, so they can be used **at the same time** to build industrial areas of two distinct varieties.<br>In addition, each variant contains two types of concrete from which the player can choose (see _Parameters_).
